        <p>Copyrights, patents, and trademarks are all Intellectual Property,
             which is a work or invention that is the result of creativity.
              According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 
              a copyright protects an original artistic or literary work,
               a patent protects an invention, and a trademark protects a brand name.
                In other words, patents protect ideas; copyrights protect the
                 expression of an idea, such as a drawing, photograph, song,
                  or written work; and a trademark protects a brand’s identity 
                  in order to distinguish its goods and services from another’s.</p>
